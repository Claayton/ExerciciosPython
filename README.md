# Resolving the exercises in Python of ‘Curso em Video’

For being in the learning process for some time, and to improve my knowledge in programming, I remade all the exercises in "Gustavo Guanabara's Python Video Course.
To add even more knowledge and make the most of my time, I'm doing the entire project in English (forgive any mistakes), and in the process also learning a little more about Git and GitHub.
